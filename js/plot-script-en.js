  "<i>They gently descended onto a lone light in the night and instantly vanished, melting in its fiery glow.</i>",
  "A sudden phone call pulled me away from my thoughts. I hurriedly tossed my cigarette away, maliciously hoping it would hit some passerby who might be walking under my window at that very moment.",
  "I shut the balcony door tightly, rubbed my frozen hands, and rushed to the phone, which seemed ready to jump off the table from vibrating so much.",
  "Glancing at the screen, I forced a fake smile:",
  "— <i>Hi, Mom. No, everything’s fine. No, I won’t be able to make it this year...</i>",
  "— <i>What do you mean? I’ve already made plans, and we’ve got our own group here.</i>",
  "— <i>Oh, come on! What drugs? What den? Mom, we’re responsible adults,</i>” I laughed falsely.",

  "It seemed like I wanted to believe my own lies. But the truth was far bleaker than my stories. Playfully congratulating my parents once again, we said goodbye until next year.",
  "I glanced at the time on the display and gloomily trudged to the kitchen—it was about time for lunch. Plus, my cat, purring and rubbing against my leg, was clearly hinting that he wouldn’t mind a treat either.",
  "After rummaging through the fridge and finding nothing to satisfy my hunger, I threw on a jacket, laced up my boots, and headed to the nearest supermarket with a heavy heart.",
  "To my surprise, it was already closed. That was strange, considering it was December 31st, and many people would still be shopping—it made no sense to close early.",
  "Giving up, I headed to the nearest McDonald’s, assuming that reasonable people would either be shopping or chopping salads at home, so it wouldn’t be as crowded as usual.",
  "At the entrance to the 'restaurant,' I almost collided with two young women.",
  "— <i>Stop, you fool!</i> - one of them shouted after the other, who had run out of the door and disappeared into the shadows of a nearby park.",
  "— <i>What are you staring at?</i>",
  "The girl glared at me with her yellow eyes. For a moment, I thought I saw something inhuman in her gaze, but she quickly looked away and followed the fleeing woman.",
  "Inside the McDonald’s, it wasn’t as crowded as I’d expected, but the usual suspects (screaming kids and their clueless moms, giggling schoolkids, and hipsters with laptops) were there.",
  "By the entrance, I noticed a sign written in neat handwriting: 'On December 31st, we’re open until the last customer!' The young woman at the counter, spotting me, sighed sadly.",
  "She was pretty, with long blond braids but very sad eyes. No wonder—being stuck here on New Year’s Eve, waiting for everyone to leave so she could finally head to her friends or boyfriend to welcome the chimes with champagne.",
  "As I approached her, I briefly considered striking up a conversation (surely no one would scold her for it—she seemed to be the only staff member left in the café), but as usual, I chickened out at the last moment, recalling my last girlfriend.",
  "Randomly choosing a burger and asking for strong coffee with it, I sat at the farthest table, hoping no one would bother me so I could quietly savor the flavor additives and dive into my gloomy thoughts.",
  "Tanya. My now-ex. What a piece of work. Oh well, I’ve already gotten over our breakup. In any case, our relationship had been cooling off for a while, and we were seeing less and less of each other.",
  "But to dump me like that, in front of our mutual friends, bringing her new boyfriend, and starting an R-rated scene right before my eyes? At that moment, I felt like a broken toy being thrown out by its owner.",
  "This happened less than a week ago, but even in that short time, I realized those so-called friends weren’t mine but hers all along. My actual friends had stopped talking to me ages ago—I never had time for them while I was 'enjoying life' with that... And now, New Year’s around the corner, and here I am, sulking alone.",
  "But why alone? A successful man with a cat.",
  "I smiled bitterly at my reflection in the coffee mug. Crumpling the burger wrapper and downing the last drops of coffee, I gathered my trash on the tray and prepared to leave. Glancing at the seat to make sure I hadn’t forgotten anything, I noticed a lilac hat.",

    "Of course, we also bought cat food and a jar of sour cream for my furry companion. At home, Julia helped set the table and happily drank juice.",
    "Julia looked truly happy, and her happiness seemed contagious, spreading like an airborne virus. Soon enough, I felt happy too.",
    "My apartment was filled with a familiar childhood scent of pine mixed with tangerines. I sat in an armchair, watching Julia squinting and hissing as she ate tangerines.",

    "Yawning, I followed her as she firmly held my hand, leading me toward the water.",

    "—<i> Look!</i>",

    "I looked forward. Before me stretched an endless sea. Along its shore, the reflections of ship pines (so that’s where the pine scent came from) danced on the water, and wispy clouds drifted lazily overhead.",

    "—<i> Yes, beautiful. And this world will be beautiful no matter what. With or without you. With you, gloomy and somber, or without you. But why spoil the bigger picture?</i>",
    "<i> All it takes is a smile and a willingness to move forward. Find someone to support you...</i>",
    "—<i> You?</i>",
    "Julia shook her head:",
    "—<i> No, I’m just a New Year’s miracle. Or maybe your personal delusion. Or guardian angel. Take your pick,</i> she smiled, <i> but do you really believe you can meet a cat-girl at McDonald’s on New Year’s Eve?</i>",

    "I jolted awake.",
    "The girl standing beside me jumped back, startled, clutching a tray for protection. I looked around: an empty McDonald’s, evening, and the same long-braided cashier.",
    "—<i> Oh...</i> she peeked out from behind the tray, <i> sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. You were sleeping so soundly, but I didn’t want to spend New Year’s Eve in McDonald’s alone...</i>",
    "I felt myself blush but tried to cheer her up:",

    "—<i> Why did you decide to spend New Year’s in McDonald’s?</i>",
    "<i>- Actually, I didn’t decide. I didn’t plan it at all. Just drifted off... had some weird dream. Sorry, your parents or friends must be waiting for you, and here you are waking up customers.</i>",
    "The girl smiled again:",
    "—<i> Not at all. Looks like I’m spending this year’s New Year’s Eve alone. But McDonald’s isn’t the best place for that.</i>",
    "I gathered all my courage and blurted out:",
    "—<i> Then let’s spend it together!</i>",
