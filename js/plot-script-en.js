["<i>Snow was slowly falling outside the window. Snowflakes swirled in a vortex, unaware that in just a moment, they would scatter in different directions and never be together again, as they once were.</i>", "<i>They gently descended onto a lone light in the night and instantly vanished, melting in its fiery glow.</i>", "A sudden phone call pulled me away from my thoughts. I hurriedly tossed my cigarette away, maliciously hoping it would hit some passerby who might be walking under my window at that very moment.", "I shut the balcony door tightly, rubbed my frozen hands, and rushed to the phone, which seemed ready to jump off the table from vibrating so much.", "Glancing at the screen, I forced a fake smile:", "— <i>Hi, Mom. No, everything’s fine. No, I won’t be able to make it this year...</i>", "— <i>What do you mean? I’ve already made plans, and we’ve got our own group here.</i>", "— <i>Oh, come on! What drugs? What den? Mom, we’re responsible adults,</i>” I laughed falsely.", "It was my mom calling, once again asking if I would come home for the New Year holidays.", "Brushing her off with excuses about work parties, gatherings with friends, and how I wanted to celebrate New Year with my girlfriend, I kept lying with every sentence.", "It seemed like I wanted to believe my own lies. But the truth was far bleaker than my stories. Playfully congratulating my parents once again, we said goodbye until next year.", "I glanced at the time on the display and gloomily trudged to the kitchen—it was about time for lunch. Plus, my cat, purring and rubbing against my leg, was clearly hinting that he wouldn’t mind a treat either.", "After rummaging through the fridge and finding nothing to satisfy my hunger, I threw on a jacket, laced up my boots, and headed to the nearest supermarket with a heavy heart.", "To my surprise, it was already closed. That was strange, considering it was December 31st, and many people would still be shopping—it made no sense to close early.", "Giving up, I headed to the nearest McDonald’s, assuming that reasonable people would either be shopping or chopping salads at home, so it wouldn’t be as crowded as usual.", "At the entrance to the 'restaurant,' I almost collided with two young women.", "— <i>Stop, you fool!</i> - one of them shouted after the other, who had run out of the door and disappeared into the shadows of a nearby park.", "— <i>What are you staring at?</i>", "The girl glared at me with her yellow eyes. For a moment, I thought I saw something inhuman in her gaze, but she quickly looked away and followed the fleeing woman.", "Inside the McDonald’s, it wasn’t as crowded as I’d expected, but the usual suspects (screaming kids and their clueless moms, giggling schoolkids, and hipsters with laptops) were there.", "By the entrance, I noticed a sign written in neat handwriting: 'On December 31st, we’re open until the last customer!' The young woman at the counter, spotting me, sighed sadly.", "She was pretty, with long blond braids but very sad eyes. No wonder—being stuck here on New Year’s Eve, waiting for everyone to leave so she could finally head to her friends or boyfriend to welcome the chimes with champagne.", "As I approached her, I briefly considered striking up a conversation (surely no one would scold her for it—she seemed to be the only staff member left in the café), but as usual, I chickened out at the last moment, recalling my last girlfriend.", "Randomly choosing a burger and asking for strong coffee with it, I sat at the farthest table, hoping no one would bother me so I could quietly savor the flavor additives and dive into my gloomy thoughts.", "Tanya. My now-ex. What a piece of work. Oh well, I’ve already gotten over our breakup. In any case, our relationship had been cooling off for a while, and we were seeing less and less of each other.", "But to dump me like that, in front of our mutual friends, bringing her new boyfriend, and starting an R-rated scene right before my eyes? At that moment, I felt like a broken toy being thrown out by its owner.", "This happened less than a week ago, but even in that short time, I realized those so-called friends weren’t mine but hers all along. My actual friends had stopped talking to me ages ago—I never had time for them while I was 'enjoying life' with that... And now, New Year’s around the corner, and here I am, sulking alone.", "But why alone? A successful man with a cat.", "I smiled bitterly at my reflection in the coffee mug. Crumpling the burger wrapper and downing the last drops of coffee, I gathered my trash on the tray and prepared to leave. Glancing at the seat to make sure I hadn’t forgotten anything, I noticed a lilac hat.", "Perhaps someone who had dined before me had left it.", ["Take the hat to the counter", "Try to find the owner of the hat"]]
